/**
 * @title LaunchpadFactory
 * @notice Deploys gas-cheap EIP-1167 clones of MemecoinBondingCurve.
 *
 * Deliberately has NO admin functions over tokens it has already
 * deployed — it can create new ones, and that's it. Two consequences:
 *  - There is no single key whose compromise puts every launched token
 *    at risk. A bug or attack against the factory can affect future
 *    deployments, never past ones.
 *  - Changing default parameters (e.g. graduation threshold) means
 *    deploying a new factory, not upgrading this one. That's a feature:
 *    it means a parameter change can never retroactively alter a token
 *    that's already live.
