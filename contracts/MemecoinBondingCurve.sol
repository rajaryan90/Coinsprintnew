/**
 * @title MemecoinBondingCurve
 * @notice A self-contained constant-product bonding curve for a single
 *         fair-launch token, priced against USDC. One instance per token,
 *         deployed as a cheap EIP-1167 clone by LaunchpadFactory.
 *
 * Design decisions (read before changing anything):
 *  - 100% of supply is minted to the curve itself at init. Nothing is
 *    pre-mined to the creator. This removes the single most common rug
 *    vector: a founder allocation that gets dumped on early buyers.
 *  - No owner, no admin functions, no pause, no upgradeability. Once
 *    initialize() runs, nobody — including whoever deployed the factory —
 *    can mint more supply, change the curve, or move funds out except
 *    through buy()/sell() at the posted curve price.
 *  - We use OpenZeppelin's *Upgradeable* ERC20 base (ERC20Upgradeable)
 *    purely because clones can't run a constructor, so state has to be
 *    set through an initializer instead. This contract is NOT upgradeable
 *    in the proxy-admin sense — there is no UUPS/Transparent proxy layer,
 *    no admin slot, nothing to point at a new implementation. "Upgradeable
 *    base, non-upgradeable deployment" is intentional: it's what makes
 *    each token's logic immutable once live.
 *  - Reentrancy protection uses OpenZeppelin's storage-based
 *    ReentrancyGuard rather than EIP-1153 transient storage. This keeps
 *    the token compatible with Arc's documented Osaka EVM baseline and
 *    avoids making every clone depend on a Cancun-only opcode. The guard
 *    is safe for clones because its zero-initialized status is accepted
 *    on the first guarded call and the modifier writes the normal entered
 *    and not-entered states before returning.
 *  - On graduation, 100% of the real (non-virtual) USDC reserve and a
 *    fixed token allocation go into a DEX pool, and the LP tokens are
 *    burned, not held. Nobody can pull that liquidity back out later —
 *    including this contract.
 *  - The 1% trade fee (TRADE_FEE_BPS) is split between the token's
 *    creator and an optional platform fee recipient, set once at launch
 *    via the factory. The split never changes what a trader pays in
 *    total — platformFeeBps takes a slice OF the existing fee, it's never
 *    added on top. Liquidity itself is never touched by this: the
 *    platform cut only ever comes out of the trading fee, never out of
 *    the USDC that backs graduation.
 *  - Optional anti-whale cap (maxWalletBps): while a token hasn't
 *    graduated yet, no single wallet can hold more than maxWalletBps of
 *    TOTAL_SUPPLY, checked on every buy. This is the direct mechanism
 *    against pump-and-dump: it stops one actor from acquiring a dominant
 *    share of supply cheaply at launch and dumping on everyone who buys
 *    after them. Off by default (0 = disabled) so it never silently
 *    changes behavior for anything already relying on the old signature;
 *    a real deployment should turn it on. The cap only applies pre-
 *    graduation — once trading moves to the DEX pool, normal market
 *    rules apply, same as any other token there.
